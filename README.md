# Description

For Test 2, we practiced using the following git commands creating a branch, creating a pull request, merging a branch into the main branch, and fetching newly created branches from the origin. We executed these commands using the Customer Order/Inventory files from Test 1. 

After creating and initializing "Test 2" repository, we created five seperate branches to execute the five Junit tests from Test 1. We used the Project Board to create a task for each Junit test that was executed on it's branch. 

To complete Test 2, the link to the repository was cloned into Eclipse. This allowed Eclipse to fetch the branches we created from the origin, update each branch with it's Junit test, and commit the changes to Github. On Github, the main branch pulled and merged the changes from each of the five created branches. After each branch was merged, its tasked was moved to the "Done" stage on the project board.
